# Color Detection using OpenCV

### Process
The idea is to select the HSV parameters that best represent the colors you want to detect.You can use the position bars from the first block of the code.

Check your results with the second block of the code.
####Example:
#### Red mask

#### Green mask

#### Blue mask

Finally, the third block gives two videos as outputs.The first video is called "inputpy.mp4" and it is the normal recording of your webcam.The second video is called "outpy.mp4" and is the video with the colors detected in the video with label and contour.
